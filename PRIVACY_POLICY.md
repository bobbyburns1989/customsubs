# Privacy Policy for CustomSubs

**Effective Date:** February 4, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

## Introduction

CustomSubs ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application ("App") handles your information.

**The Short Version:** CustomSubs is designed to be 100% private. We don't collect, transmit, or store any of your data on our servers. All your subscription information stays on your device, forever. We have no servers, no analytics, and no way to access your data.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

CustomSubs is fundamentally different from most apps. Here's what we **DO NOT** do:

- ❌ We do NOT collect your personal information
- ❌ We do NOT require account creation or login
- ❌ We do NOT connect to our servers (we have no servers)
- ❌ We do NOT track your usage or behavior
- ❌ We do NOT use analytics or crash reporting services
- ❌ We do NOT share your data with third parties
- ❌ We do NOT display advertisements
- ❌ We do NOT access your bank accounts, emails, or other apps
- ❌ We do NOT make network connections of any kind

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local-Only Storage

All subscription data you enter into CustomSubs is stored **exclusively on your device** using a local database (Hive). This includes:

- Subscription names, amounts, and billing cycles
- Reminder settings and notification preferences
- Cancellation information (URLs, phone numbers, notes)
- Custom notes and settings

### Data You Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export:** You can export all your subscription data as a JSON file at any time via Settings → Export Backup
- **Import:** You can restore your data from a previously exported JSON file
- **Delete:** You can permanently delete all data via Settings → Delete All Data
- **Share:** When you export data, you choose where to save it (iCloud, Google Drive, email, etc.) using your device's native share functionality

### Data Persistence

Your data persists only on your device until you:
1. Manually delete it via the app's Settings, or
2. Uninstall the app (which removes all local data)

**Important:** If you uninstall the app without first exporting your data, all subscription information will be permanently lost. We cannot recover it because it was never transmitted to us.

## Permissions Required

CustomSubs requests the following device permissions:

### Notifications (Required)
- **Purpose:** To send you reminders before subscription charges
- **Data:** Notification content is generated locally on your device and never transmitted anywhere
- **Control:** You can disable notifications in your device settings at any time

### Storage Access (iOS/Android)
- **Purpose:** To export backup files and import previously saved backups
- **Data:** You choose what to export and where to save it
- **Control:** Storage access is only used when you explicitly tap "Export Backup" or "Import Backup"

### No Other Permissions
CustomSubs does NOT request or use:
- Camera, microphone, or photo library access
- Location services
- Contact list access
- Calendar access
- Any other device sensors or data

## Third-Party Services

CustomSubs does NOT integrate with any third-party services, including:

- Analytics providers (Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Crash reporting services (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Cloud storage providers (except via your device's native share sheet)
- Social media platforms
- Payment processors (the app is free with no in-app purchases)

## Children's Privacy

CustomSubs does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Economic Area). Since we don't collect any data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages.

However, the app is designed for users who have subscription services to track, which typically requires users to be adults or teens with parental permission to subscribe to services.

## Data Security

### Local Security

Your data is stored in a local database on your device, protected by your device's native security features:
- iOS: Protected by iOS sandboxing and device encryption
- Android: Protected by Android app sandboxing and device encryption

If you enable device encryption and screen lock, your CustomSubs data benefits from that additional security.

### No Network Transmission

Because CustomSubs never transmits data over the internet, your subscription information is protected from:
- Network interception or eavesdropping
- Server breaches or data leaks
- Unauthorized third-party access
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

### Export Security

When you export your data:
- The JSON file is unencrypted (human-readable) for compatibility
- You control where the file is stored (iCloud, Google Drive, local storage, etc.)
- If you store exports in cloud services, those services' security policies apply
- We recommend storing exports in password-protected or encrypted locations

## Your Rights

### Data Access
You have complete access to all your data at all times. Simply open the app to view all stored subscriptions.

### Data Portability
You can export your data as a JSON file, which is:
- Human-readable and editable
- Compatible with standard text editors
- Importable back into CustomSubs
- Your property to use, share, or delete as you wish

### Data Deletion
You can delete your data at any time:
1. Delete individual subscriptions via the app interface
2. Delete all data via Settings → Delete All Data
3. Uninstall the app to remove all local data

### Right to Object
Since we don't collect, process, or share your data, there's nothing to object to.

## International Users

CustomSubs is designed to be compliant with privacy regulations worldwide, including:

### GDPR (European Union)
- **Legal Basis:** Not applicable - we don't process personal data
- **Data Controller:** Not applicable - no data is collected
- **Data Transfers:** Not applicable - no data leaves your device
- **Right to Erasure:** Delete data anytime via app settings or uninstall

### CCPA (California, USA)
- **Sale of Personal Information:** We do not sell personal information
- **Data Collection:** We do not collect personal information
- **Opt-Out:** Not applicable - no data is collected
- **Disclosure:** This policy serves as our CCPA disclosure

### Other Jurisdictions
CustomSubs's design ensures compliance with privacy laws in virtually all jurisdictions because we simply don't collect any personal data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to:
- Reflect changes in our app features
- Comply with new legal requirements
- Improve clarity and transparency

When we make changes:
1. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
2. We will notify users via an in-app message upon opening the app after an update
3. The updated policy will be available at customsubs.us/privacy

Continued use of the app after policy updates constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Technical Transparency

For technically-minded users, here are additional details:

### Code Verification
CustomSubs is designed to be open and transparent:
- Source code may be made available for inspection (future consideration)
- No obfuscated network calls
- All data operations are local Hive database operations

### Network Monitoring
If you monitor your device's network traffic, you will observe:
- **Zero HTTP/HTTPS requests** from CustomSubs
- **Zero DNS queries** originating from the app
- **Zero data transmission** of any kind

The only network activity that may occur is:
1. When you tap a cancellation URL (opens in your browser, not our app)
2. When you tap a phone number (opens your phone app)
3. When you share a backup file via your device's share sheet

All of these are initiated by **you** and handled by **your device's system apps**, not CustomSubs.

## App Store Privacy Nutrition Labels

For transparency, here's what we declare in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store privacy labels:

**Data Collected:** None
**Data Linked to You:** None
**Data Used to Track You:** None
**Data Not Collected:** All categories

## Conclusion

CustomSubs is built on a simple principle: **your financial data belongs to you, and only you**.

We designed the app to be technically incapable of accessing your data. This isn't just a promise—it's a technical reality. We have no servers, no backend, no cloud infrastructure, and no way to see what you're tracking.

This privacy policy is longer than most, not because we do a lot with your data, but because we want to be crystal clear about what we **don't** do.

**Your data. Your device. Your privacy. Always.**
