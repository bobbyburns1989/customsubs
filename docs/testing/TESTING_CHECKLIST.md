- [ ] **Android**: Tap "View Details" → app opens to that subscription's detail screen

  - [ ] Quarterly ÷ 3
  - [ ] Biannual ÷ 6
  - [ ] Yearly ÷ 12
- [ ] Conversions use bundled exchange rates

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Biannual advances 6 months
- [ ] Yearly advances 1 year

### "Mark as Paid" Reset
- [ ] Marking paid sets `isPaid = true`
- [ ] When billing date advances, `isPaid` resets to `false`
- [ ] Paid status doesn't carry over to next cycle

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Subscription created with past date → advances immediately
- [ ] Billing date exactly today → shows "Today", doesn't advance until tomorrow
- [ ] App not opened for 3 months → all dates advance to current
- [ ] February 29 (leap year) → advances correctly to Feb 28 next year
- [ ] Daylight saving time changes → dates unaffected

---

## 12. Backup & Restore
