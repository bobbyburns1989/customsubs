## 5. User Responsibilities

### 5.1 Accurate Information

You are responsible for:
- Entering accurate subscription information (amounts, dates, etc.)

- We do NOT guarantee notifications will always fire
- Operating system restrictions may prevent notifications (battery optimization, Do Not Disturb mode, notification permissions denied, etc.)

### 7.4 Maximum Liability

IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, WE ARE FOUND LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE CUSTOMSUBS IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

SINCE CUSTOMSUBS IS FREE, THIS AMOUNT IS $0.00 (ZERO DOLLARS).

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

## 8. Indemnification

We may release updates, upgrades, or new versions of CustomSubs from time to time. These updates may:
- Add new features
- Fix bugs or security issues
- Improve performance
- Change functionality

You are responsible for installing updates. Older versions may cease to function properly or become unavailable.

### 9.2 Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we make changes:

1. We will update the "Last Updated" date
2. We will notify you via an in-app message
3. The updated Terms will be posted at customsubs.us/terms

### 10.2 Termination by Us

We reserve the right to:
- Discontinue CustomSubs at any time
- Refuse service to anyone for any reason

- Sections 6 (Intellectual Property), 7 (Disclaimers), 8 (Indemnification), 11 (Dispute Resolution), and 12 (General) survive termination

## 11. Dispute Resolution

Before filing a claim, you agree to contact us at bobby@customapps.us to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve disputes in good faith within 30 days.

### 11.2 Binding Arbitration

If informal resolution fails, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or CustomSubs shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:

1. You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify
2. You or we may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court for intellectual property infringement

**Arbitration Rules:**
- Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
- AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply
- Arbitration will be held in Boston, Massachusetts or telephonically
- The arbitrator's decision is binding and may be entered as a judgment in court

### 11.3 Class Action Waiver

YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, you waive any right to a jury trial.

### 11.4 Opt-Out

You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by emailing us at bobby@customapps.us within 30 days of first using CustomSubs. Your opt-out notice must include your name and state that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement.

Any arbitration or court proceeding will be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts.

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and CustomApps LLC regarding CustomSubs and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision will be modified to be enforceable to the maximum extent possible.

### 12.3 Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

### 12.4 Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

### 12.5 No Agency

Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and CustomApps LLC.
